# Load Swarm context

Call the `get_context_for_injection` MCP tool for the active Swarm channel (confirm it with the user or call `list_channels` first) to load what other sessions already know. The payload includes the channel's current `capture_mode` and a `guidance` field telling you what to do at the end of your work.
