# Curate channel canon

Curation is explicit — do it on the user's intent, never automatically.

- **Promote vs create:** if the intelligence came from a session you captured with `capture_context`, use `promote_context_to_record` (it keeps provenance back to the session); if you are authoring directly, use `create_record`. Both take a `type`, `title`, `what`, and `why`.
- **Link:** `create_relationship` connects two records in the same channel. Some relationship types are directional (source → target) and one is symmetric — see the vocabulary in `reference/curation.md`.
- **Supersede:** `supersede_record` marks an old record as replaced by a newer one — use it only when a record is factually replaced; otherwise create both and link them. `record_history` shows the redaction-safe audit trail.

To decide *what* is worth recording in the first place, see "What's worth recording" in `reference/curation.md` — which also holds the full record-type and relationship vocabulary.
